So, I'm on the road towards learning [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org), via
Stuart Halloway's [Programming
Clojure](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj). It's an OK book, hardly the
gem (no pun intended) that the pickaxe was. However, it
_is_ thorough, and is less disjointed than simply googling
around for Clojure info and docs.

With all that in mind, [Casting SPELs in Clojure](http://www.lisperati.com
/clojure-spels/casting.html) is a welcome companion to Halloway's book
(perhaps best as an introduction). While not nearly as comprehensive, it's
more readable, and has a more fluid style. After I get through the basics of
Clojure, I'm looking forward to finally learning about [Monads in
Clojure](http://onclojure.com/2009/03/05/a-monad-tutorial-for-clojure-
programmers-part-1/).
