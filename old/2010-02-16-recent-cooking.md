I've been making some slightly odd food recently. To start with I made a dish
from a '70s dairy centric cookbook, California Sour Cream Shrimp, which is
shrimp cooked in a sour cream&nbsp_place_holder; and onion sauce with tomatoes
and avocado (hence the California) seasoned with curry powder. The dish came
out a sort of neon '70s yellow, that was initially off putting, but quickly
made up for by the fairly good taste.

I also experimented with making tacos using Ezekiel tortillas, that is
tortillas using only sprouted grains. I'm not sure Ezekiel bread makes for the
best tortilla, but you can't argue with the health of these tacos, Grass Fed
beef, spices, cilantro, red peppers, and some sharp cheddar. Definitely not a
conventional taco.
