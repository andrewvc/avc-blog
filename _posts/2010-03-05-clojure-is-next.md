I've been mulling over learning a new language for the last few months, I've
done bits of reading here and there on Haskell, Lisp (via SICP), and a couple
other languages. The more time I spend looking the more Clojure likes the
answer. Haskell looks fascinating, but at the end of the day, perhaps too
baroque and just not as useful. Lisp + the power and libs of the JVM seems
flat out awesome. Worth reading are these excellent slides by Clojure's
creator:
