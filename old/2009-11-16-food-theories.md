Via Cranky Fitness:

Food high in[ Saturated Fat makes you not feel full when you in fact
are.](http://www.crankyfitness.com/2009/10/well-that-explains-lot-of-
things.html)

Also, [Low Carb Diets make you more
unhappy.](http://www.crankyfitness.com/2009/11/does-low-carb-make-you-
crankier-than.html)

I'm not totally convinced, at least that's what I'm telling myself to explain
dinner tonight. I went with the High Carb, High Fat, High Everything diet.

On the menu: Baked Potato w/ Pancetta, Swiss, and Creme Fraiche.
