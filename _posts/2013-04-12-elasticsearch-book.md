I've released an early draft of an elasticearch book I'm writing, [exploring-elasticsearch](http://exploringelasticsearch.com). A bit of backstory about this book:

This is the guide I wish I'd had when I picked up elasticsearch. The process of learning it at the moment is extroardinarily painful. The official docs, while invaluable, are far from complete. Additionally, they lack a narrative, and there's no obvious place to start. While much of elasticsearch is obvious to Lucene pros, for those new to Lucene it is daunting. The goal here isn't to create a reference, but a guide. To put people on a solid path for learning elasticsearch and solving complex problems.

If you've got feedback on the book shoot me an email at andrew at andrewvc dot com!
