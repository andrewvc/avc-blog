I've recently finished reading the Project Gutenberg edition of The Adventures
of Sherlock Holmes. Since, I was reading it on my oh so Convenient Kindle,
annotation was quite easy. I ended up making a list words and phrases I needed
to look up. Some of these words are still in common use in the British Isles,
so be forewarned there's an American bias here.

1. Pips - Small, hard seed in a fruit.  
2. Vesta - a short match with a shank of wax-coated threads; also : a short wooden match  
3. Mousseline de soie - A fine crisp fabric made of silk  
4. [Gladstone Bag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladstone_bag) - a small portmanteau suitcase built over a rigid frame which could separate into two equal sections.
