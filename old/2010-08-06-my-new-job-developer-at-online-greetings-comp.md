# My New Job: Developer at Online Greetings Company Cocodot

So, it's been a month, and I still haven't put it up here, I'm now working as
a Rails developer for online invitations and greetings company
[cocodot](http://cocodot.com/).

If you haven't see cocodot, it's a pretty interesting concept that I'm quite
excited about. We occupy the the greetings space, but have better execution
than the competition, we probably have the best designed greetings and cards
of anyone out there, thanks to an amazing creative staff. The [wedding
invitations](http://cocodot.com/wedding) system is pretty slick as well, it's
probably the best way to do online wedding invitations at the moment.
