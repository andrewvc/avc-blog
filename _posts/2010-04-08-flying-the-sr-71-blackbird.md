["On a typical training mission, we would take off near Sacramento, refuel
over Nevada, accelerate into Montana, obtain high Mach over Colorado, turn
right over New Mexico, speed across the Los Angeles Basin, run up the West
Coast, turn right at Seattle, then return to Beale. Total flight time: two
hours and 40 minutes."](http://www.vfp62.com/SR-71.html)
