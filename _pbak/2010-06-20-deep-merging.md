# Deep Merging

The [deep merge gem](http://www.misuse.org/science/2008/05/19/deep_merge-ruby-
recursive-merging-for-hashes/)  seems like it could be useful in a good number
of situations dealing with MongoDB and nested documents. Currently I'm trying
to use as much JSON as possible, serializing forms to it in JS client-side,
validating it in Rails, then sending it over to MongoDB. I don't think I'll
need it yet, as I'm usually not dealing with fragments of documents, but I can
definitely see this coming into play later.
