Out in Wyoming, by the Grand Targhee Ski Resort is a stretch of smooth asphalt
traversing a steep decent. Perfect for street skateboarding. Brandon Gust grew
up skateboarding out there and is making a video about it. Check out some
video [samples](http://www.thesnaz.com/2009/11/02/the-road/) at the Snaz after
the jump.
