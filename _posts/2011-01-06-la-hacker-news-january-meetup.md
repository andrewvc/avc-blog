This month's [Los Angeles Hacker News](http://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-
Hacker-News/)&nbsp_place_holder;meetup is going to be pretty damn fun. We've
got a series of excellent talks at coloft in Santa Monica this month from John
Buckman, Aman Gupta, and Giles Bowkett. Check out the [January Meetup
Page](http://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Hacker-News/calendar/15839764/) for
details.

Additionally, we'll probably have another drinkup at Biergarten couple weeks
after this meetup.
