I've recently made a big move, As a 7 year long ViM and Emacs user, switching to a new text editor
feels akin to switching to a new religion. So, I was especially surprised to find myself absolutely
loving a big fat honking IDE, [Ruby Mine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/). 
It's been a dream as far as both Ruby and Typescript/Javascript dev. I'd like to explore why.

Throughout my time in the software industry, I've tried many editors, though for most of
my career ViM, and Emacs have been my tools of choice. Sure, there were many before them,
jedit, gedit, kedit, notepad++, dreamweaver, ultraedit, bbedit, atom, Rad Rails, and probably whole bunch I've now
forgotten about. 

ViM and Emacs however seemed like perfection once I actually learned their arcane ways. I used ViM for years when I worked
mostly as a Systems Administrator and Rails developer, switching to Emacs when I wanted 
better Clojure support (back in the early days of Clojure). However, at some point this year I got sick
of Emacs for OSX causing my CPU to spin once again, and decided to try out a bunch of new editors.
I spent a while stuck on Atom, liking its UI, but hating its instability, before landing on Ruby Mine.

So, I've sat down and compiled a list of pros and cons I've experienced with Ruby Mine. On balance,
I'm very happy with it, I hope others find this useful :).

*Pros*

* An amazing debugger
* Full emacs key binding support, easily customizable to my needs
* Great Javascript/Typescript support. With typescript it really shines
* No need to manage a bunch of confusing text configuration files
* One clear, high quality way to do things, instead of a million open source packages in various states of repair
* A sane window splitting/switching mechanism
* I use IntelliJ for Java/Clojure (via cursive), it's nice to stay in the same family
* I love being able to just right click on a test I want to run or debug and having it do the right thing
* Full JRuby support
* Good Vagrant support

*Cons*

* Need to edit a random python file? Nope, Rubymine is Ruby / JS / Shell only
* Still a little laggy, even on my mid-2014 15" MBP w/ 16GB ram
* Needs manual switch via text config to JDK8 on OSX to get Retina support
* Costs actual money, though with their startup program, it was only $100
* Irritating support system, though the actual staff is quite nice. Issues could be simpler
