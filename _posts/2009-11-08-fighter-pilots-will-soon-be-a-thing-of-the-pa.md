A [fascinating
article](http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htmoral/articles/20091102.aspx) on
strategy pages about the inevitability of an all unmanned fighter fleet. An
interesting thing to note about this switch is that UAV Pilots [are starting
to show signs of PTSD](http://www.military.com/news/article/predator-pilots-
suffering-war-stress.html?col=1186032310810&wh=news). The New Yorker covered
this in a recent article I can't find online. They made the point that people
aren't quite comfortable killing people remotely, it removes the element of
danger for the killer. By taking your troops off the battlefield, and
eliminating all risk, the notion of being a warrior is significantly changed.
