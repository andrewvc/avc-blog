This year my contribution to my family's thanksgiving meal was a pear and
blueberry gallete. I made a modified version of [Alton Brown's No-Pan pear
pie.](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/no-pan-pear-pie-
recipe/index.html) This is really a gallete, a freeform tart, but it's quite
pie-like. The crust uses corn-meal, which I'd not used in a crust before. I
must say the corn meal adds a bit of crunch and grit that's fantastic.

I made a few modifications to this recipe to suit my own tastes. I'm not much
of a sweet tooth, so I used 5 pears instead of 2, and got rid of the pound
cake for the filling. I also multiplied the crust ingredients by 1.5 since
some commenters on the recipe page mentioned the pie this made wasn't very
big. This maxed out my food processor's capacity, and gave me just enough
crust for the different quantity of filling. I also added in a more sugar to
the filling to compensate for the reduction in sweetness I anticipated from
removing the pound cake. The result was delicious. With these ingredients it
created a gallete that had about 12 2"x5" pieces.
