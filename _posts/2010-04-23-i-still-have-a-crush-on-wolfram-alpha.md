I have to admit right now that I've got a crush on [Wolfram
Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com). Sadly, the "Computational Knowledge
Engine" was latched onto by the media and over hyped. It's not going to change
the world, as some reports breathlessly prophesied, and I have a feeling that
a lot of people ended up writing it off as a cute toy, but for day to to day
stuff, I've just found it generally awesome, like the google calculator on
steroids,

These are some real world queries I as a sysadmin/programmer use it for:

1. [Calculate the relative cost of hosting plans](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=12000+gb+per+month+at+%240.30/gb+vs+(200+mbps)+at+%249/mbps/month), even if one uses GiB/mo and the other uses mbps @ the 95th percentile.

2. Compare the [running time of algorithms](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot+%5B%7B1%2Clog+x%2Cx%2C+x+log+x%7D%2C+%7Bx%2C+1%2C+10%7D%5D+) using Big O notation

3. Calculate, when, say [30 days ago was](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=30+days+ago), or even [5 sundays ago](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5+sundays+ago), or something simple like [2 weeks in seconds](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+weeks+in+seconds),  or [feed it a Unix time](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=unixtime+1271994103) and get a bunch of useful info about it. 

4. [How many horsepower can you get out of 1 carrot per hour](http://www.wolfr
amalpha.com/input/?i=((1+carrot+calories+in+btu)+/+1+hour)) (ok, maybe I've
never actually had to use this one, but pondering the fuel consumption of
horses is entertaining).
