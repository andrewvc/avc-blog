title: Learn ZeroMQ in Ruby With These Examples...

I've started releasing [a series of learn by example ZeroMQ
lessons](http://github.com/andrewvc/learn-ruby-zeromq) on github, you'll be
able to receive updates with a simple git pull. There wasn't much in the way
of docs / manuals / guides for ZeroMQ in the Ruby world, hopefully this will
help fill that void.

Most of the current docs are either for the C api, or in the man pages. While
fairly comprehensive, they're daunting, dense, and take a lot of time to go
through.

These examples are a work in progress, I'd appreciate feedback and
contributions as I move forward. If you finish these examples, I highly
recommend reading the ZeroMQ [man pages](http://api.zeromq.org/zmq.html) and
the [official site](http://www.zeromq.org/), even if they're a bit dense, for
a more in-depth look at ZeroMQ.
