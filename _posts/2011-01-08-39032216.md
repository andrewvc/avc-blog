> In the third act of _Hamlet_, Shakespeare erects a stage on the stage; the
fact that the play enacted there--the poisoning of a king--in some way mirrors
the primary play suffices to suggest the posibility of infinite involutions.
(In an 1840 article, De Quincey observes that the stolid, heavy-handed style
of this minor play makes the overall drama that includes it appear, by
contrast, more lifelike. I would add that its essential aim is the opposite:
to make reality appear unreal to us.)

-- Jorge Luis Borges, From his essay "When Fiction Lives in Fiction"
