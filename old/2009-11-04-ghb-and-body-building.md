# GHB and Body Building

This article about GHB and bodybuilding is fascinating. I'm not a bodybuilder
(obviously), but it's an interesting look into how a fringe drug culture,
which body building to a certain extent is,&nbsp_place_holder;analyzes
substances. It's interesting when the veneer of scientific reasoning erodes,
leaving a strange alloy of prose: "A combination of&nbsp_place_holder;the two
can allow a a shitfaced intoxication subjectively
quite&nbsp_place_holder;similar to that produced by alcohol, but with the
consumption of only a few drinks, thus only a few hundred calories."

This reminded me of the documentary Bigger Stronger Faster, an amazing film
about Steroid use:
